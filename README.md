# udpchat

This project can either be built in QT Creator or on the command line with the following two commands:

```
qmake udpchat.pro
make
```

The executable can then be launched with:

```
./UDPChat
```

A GUI will appear. The usage is straightforward: the button "Alice" sends any text in the left column's textbox to Bob, and the button "Bob" sends any text in the right column's textbox to Alice.
